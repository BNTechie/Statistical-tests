# Statistical power and sample size calculation: 

Statistical power and sample size calculations are critical components of study design in statistics. They ensure that a study has a sufficient sample size to detect a statistically significant effect if one exists.

Key Concepts
**Statistical Power:** The probability that a test correctly rejects the null hypothesis when a specific alternative hypothesis is true. A commonly desired power is 0.80, meaning there is an 80% chance of detecting an effect if there is one.

**Sample Size:** The number of observations or replicates included in the study. Larger sample sizes generally lead to higher power.

**Effect Size:** A measure of the strength of the relationship between two variables. Larger effect sizes are easier to detect.

**Significance Level (Î±):** The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. Commonly set at 0.05.
